# HRSChallenge Part 2


Your task for Part 2 is to review a piece of existing code and demonstrate how you would improve it. The code is in the included file named PatientModel.ts.

1. Explain the purpose of the filterLatestReadings function as best as you can.
2. How would you improve the code for readability, maintainability, etc? This can include anything from small changes to rewriting it entirely. Explanations of your reasoning behind your changes is recommended. You can choose to make the changes to the function directly, or to write pseudocode to demonstrate your thinking, or to explain your thoughts in any other way that would effectively convey them to us.


# Answer1: 
FilterLastestReadings Function, describe the overall readings of patients who are admitted or enrolled. If also describes the readings from 
most recent to least recent's on the basics of the date. This function is also figure the values which are deleted or removed and organized
it in the descending order using timestamp.
Secondly it also caters the sorting values whether it's in ascending or descending by using angular filter method.


# Answer2: 
Readability: It can be increased by using proper structure of coding and 				also the comments, which helps very much in reading and 					understanding the code.
Maintainability : It can be increased by using generic code not the specific code. generic code means the variables and function name should be generic
			   so it could be use anywhere in the application. 
			   Example :
			
			//this function can be used to show any type of data whether patient or doctor. 
			showData(args){
				return args;		
			}  
			
		moreover the code is written with good programming skills. these were some points which i need to share, thankyou.
